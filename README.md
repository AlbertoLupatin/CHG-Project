# Computational Human Genomics Project (2024)

This repository contains the code used for my Computational Human Genomics Project, focused on detecting and interpreting somatic genomic aberrations in oncology. The project aims to uncover clinically relevant somatic events using tumor and control DNA sequencing data (BAM files) from a single oncologic patient.
